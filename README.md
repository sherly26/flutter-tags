# flutter-tags
This is my own implementation of tags, feel free to use this code. &lt;3 

I made a dialog to select the tags and once the dialog is closed, the screen updates and shows the tags. You can unselect the tags by clicking the X on the tag and by unselect it in the dialog. 

You must have a list or map of objects with at least these two properties: 
-Tag name: must be string. 
-Tag is Active: must be bool. 

So the app knows when to show the tag in the screen or mark the checkbox as selected in the dialog.
